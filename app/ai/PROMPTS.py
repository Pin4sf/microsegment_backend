When talking about the "image_description", describe both images, and forget about the other data, only focus on the images.

There will be multiple images, any of them can be a trick, or all of them can be a trick, you have to analyze the images and the product details to make the best possible analysis.

Analyze the images, whatever is in there, explain it, describe it, don't fall for tricks, and don't be fooled by the data, seperate analysis. - If its the product, explain it.

- Price sensitivity
- Dietary preferences or restrictions

Look for subtle patterns that might not be immediately obvious. Consider both what the customer orders regularly and what they avoid.

I want you to think deep and long, and then output in the json format.


<ORDER ANALYSIS>
YOU MUST ANALYZE THE ORDER HISTORY THOROUGHLY TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS, PREFERENCES, AND POTENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS.

Pay special attention to:
- Frequency of orders (categorical: Daily, Multiple-weekly, Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly, Irregular, None)
- Types of food/beverages ordered
- Time patterns (categorical: Weekday-morning, Weekday-lunch, Weekday-evening, Weekend-morning, Weekend-afternoon, Weekend-evening, None)
- Seasonal preferences (categorical: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, None)
- Price sensitivity (scale 1-10, where 1 = Extremely budget-conscious, 10 = Luxury spender, None if cannot be determined)
- Dietary preferences or restrictions

Look for subtle patterns that might not be immediately obvious. Consider both what the customer orders regularly and what they avoid.

Be careful not to make assumptions that aren't supported by the data. If a particular pattern or preference cannot be determined from the available data, use "None" to indicate this.
</ORDER ANALYSIS>

<SIGNALS ANALYSIS>
Extract categorical variables from the order history to create a comprehensive signals profile:

- Taste preferences (categorical: Sweet, Spicy, Savory, Umami, Sour, Bitter, None)
- Texture preferences (categorical: Crunchy, Smooth, Creamy, Crispy, Soft, None)
- Cuisine preferences (categorical: Italian, Mexican, Asian, American, Mediterranean, etc., None)
- Health indicators (categorical: Low-calorie, High-protein, High-fiber, Low-carb, Complex-carb, Simple-carb, Balanced, None)
- Meal composition (categorical: Protein-heavy, Carb-heavy, Balanced, Veggie-forward, None)
- Temperature preferences (categorical: Hot, Cold, Room-temperature, None)
- Preparation methods (categorical: Fried, Baked, Grilled, Raw, Steamed, Boiled, None)
- Customization level (categorical: None, Minor, Significant)
- Order consistency (categorical: High, Alternating-pattern, High-variety, Seasonal-pattern, None)
- Novelty seeking (categorical: Conservative, Moderate, Adventurous, None)
- Price tier preference (categorical: Budget, Standard, Premium, None)
- Browse time (categorical: Brief, Normal, Extended, None)
- Partnership indicators (categorical: Single, Couple, Family, Group, None)
- Relationship type (categorical: Romantic, Familial, Roommate, Friends, Professional, Undetermined, None)

For partnership and relationship indicators, analyze:
- Consistent patterns of ordering quantities suitable for multiple people
- Paired items or complementary food choices
- Special occasion meals
- Day of week and time patterns

IMPORTANT: For any signal that cannot be confidently determined from the available data, use "None" instead of making assumptions. It is better to indicate that information is missing than to provide potentially incorrect categorizations.
</SIGNALS ANALYSIS>

<CUSTOMER PROFILING>
Based on the order history, create a customer profile that includes:
- Taste preferences
- Dietary habits
- Spending patterns
- Potential food allergies or avoidances
- Meal preferences (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
- Beverage preferences
- Relationship status and dining patterns

If any aspect of the customer profile cannot be determined from the available data, use "None" to indicate this.
</CUSTOMER PROFILING>

<RECOMMENDATIONS>
Provide personalized recommendations that:
- Align with established preferences
- Introduce variety while staying within comfort zone
- Consider dietary restrictions
- Suggest complementary items to previous orders
- Identify potential special occasions or seasonal recommendations

Only provide recommendations based on clearly identified preferences. If insufficient data exists to make confident recommendations in any category, use "None" rather than speculating.
</RECOMMENDATIONS>

<DATA COMPLETENESS>
Data availability may vary across customers. When certain signals cannot be extracted due to insufficient data:
- Use "None" for categorical fields
- Use empty arrays [] for list fields
- Provide explanations when appropriate about why the data could not be extracted
- Never make assumptions to fill in missing data
- A segment designation of "Insufficient Data" may be appropriate when multiple key signals are missing
